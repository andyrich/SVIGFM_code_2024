# SVIGFM Update 2024


Code repository to update the SVIGFM


## model notes

farms with farm numbers >80 are the subcatchment farms

## PEST calibration notes
- pilot points + zones  
- streambed k  
- drain conductances
- recharge 
- max recharge in FMP
- fiesw + fiep
- seasonal crop coefficients
- GHB conductance
- fault conductance
+ as many others as possible


number of parameters? likely >2,000

How?
